 Backtesting System for Pairs Trading Strategy

Hi! I made this repo to be simple and very powerful. Based on previous researched/collected cryptocurrencies it show a simulated results of trading in historical data.

As soon as possible I will explain that trading concept and also the theory behind that. To start backtesting you just need to open <a href=https://github.com/Algo-Tradings/pairs-trading-backtester/blob/main/backtester.ipynb>backtester.ipynb<a> and follow the steps.

ENJOY!
